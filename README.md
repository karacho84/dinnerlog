DinerLog
=========

A lightweight nutrition logger written in python

Installing
----------
Install python >= 3

Running
-------
Run 'main.py' with python

ToDo
----
- Add statistics (graph showing kcal for the past x days)
- Externalize strings for localization, then: add foreign language support!
- Handle button states (disable and enable only if context is matching)
- Handle errors!
- CSV ex-/import
- Low prio:
 - Extended stats: averages kcal/day and so on
 - A menu maybe. A GUI just needs that
